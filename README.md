## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

## Authentication used

This application uses email as the username for authentication. The default password for all users is `password`.

## Bearer Token Authentication

This application supports authentication using Bearer tokens. To access protected API endpoints, include an `Authorization` header in your HTTP requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your personal access token. Ensure you keep your token secure and do not share it publicly.

## Seeders

To extract all the data using seeders, run the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

This command will execute all the seeders registered in the `DatabaseSeeder` class and populate your database with the sample data.

If you want to run a specific seeder, use:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=YourSeederClassName
```

Make sure your database is configured correctly in the `.env` file before running the seeders.
